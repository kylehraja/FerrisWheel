# Ferris Wheel
A Ferris Wheel built using HTML and CSS. I used CSS to animate elements, transform them, and adjust their speed. The Position property is used for the wheel and cabins.

I used animated properities such as:
animation-name:;
animation-duration:;
animation-iteration-count:;
animation-timing-function:;

The wheel rotates starting at 0deg and ends on 360deg. The cabins rotate starting at 0deg and ends on -360deg. This makes it so the cabins never flip upside down, just like a ferris wheel.
